#someone else's code on 3rd line to hide player input. this is done in python as a learning project. brand new coder. don't hate :

from getpass import getpass as input
p1c = input("Player 1 do you choose r,p, or s?")
p2c = input("Player 2 do you choose r,p, or s?")  
if p1c == p2c:
  print("Draw! Play again!")
else:
  if p1c == "r" and p2c == "s":
    print("Player 1 wins with Rock!")
  elif p1c == "r" and p2c == "p":
    print("Player 2 wins with Paper!")
  else:
    if p1c == "p" and p2c == "r":
      print("Player 1 wins with Paper!")
    elif p1c == "p" and p2c == "s":
      print("Player 2 wins with Scissors!")
    else:
      if p1c == "s" and p2c == "p":
        print("Player 1 wins with Scissors!")
      elif p1c == "s" and p2c == "r":
        print("Player 2 wins with Rock!")
